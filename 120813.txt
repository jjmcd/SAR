get on site, UTM location for subject, first target lkp or ipp

go do interviews, some may have already been established
to determine subject category
kester category determines percentile distances from lkp per category
Also investigation tasks, hallmark behaviors, sercher behaviors by cat

After 2 hours blow off initial speed calcs
Median and probable distances
In MI 50%tile minimum to search
always try to clear 50%ile

In any search, there is information you don't give out.
How they distinguish bogus reports
Also public consumption piece (flyers) doesn't have behavioral stuff

Hasty tasks reminder to search manager
Actual searcher tasks/behaviors
description of profile

subject info handout sheet ^^^^

Run a script to calculate circle, manhours to clear.  Kent model used
seems optimistic, x4 reasonable guess.

within 200m lkp has to gt cleared don't need to plan go do this!
targeting sectors 50 acres or less depending on topography
amdr average mean detection range
searchers=total heads, might be n teams
use jgr @ r frontend

R take input ss, then checks input, runs models
output file = input file

Result graphs hours 
kent model vs nasar model  
umber searchers vs. time to clear
next graph how fast, speed vs spacing
last graph probability of detection (fu fu math) based on spacing and
amdr

if probability is gelow 0.6 you're not done
